mcabbernotify.py
******************
******************

SETTING UP EVENTS COMMAND
=============================
In order for mcabbernotify.py to read anything, you will need to set the following
options in your mcabberrc file that you use:
	set events_command = ~/.mcabber/eventcmd
	set events_ignore_active_window = 1

Then you'll want to move the "eventcmd" in this directory into ~/.mcabber and make sure it is executable


USING IT LOCALLY
===================
If you use mcabber on your local machine, you will simply need to run:
	tail -f ~/.mcabber/last_event | path/to/mcabbernotify.py


USING IT REMOTELY
===================
In the situation where you run mcabber remotely, and want notifications locally, you can use the following command:
	ssh hostname -C "tail -f ~/.mcabber/last_event" | path/to/mcabbernotify.py
